#### Framework for Signal processing. [USING PYTHON]

### It has the following features: 

- ## The ability to read samples of a signal from a txt file and display it in both continuous and discrete representations.

- ## The ability to generate sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals, the user should choose whether he wants cosine or sine, the amplitude A, the phase shift theta, the analog frequency, and the sampling frequency needed. (Hint: the sampling frequency chosen should obey the sampling theorem)
